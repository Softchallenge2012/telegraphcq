This directory contains a sample wrapper implementaion.  The
requirements for a wrapper function are explained in the wrapper
clearinghouse documentation which can be found in the document
wrapper.doc or wrapper.html in this directory.

The  sample wrapper consumes a stream of long integers.  The wrapper
returns tuples which consist of two integer values from the stream and
a wrapper generated timestamp.

Build the wrapper using the make command, then install libwrapper.so in 
the postgres lib directory. 

Once the library has been built, start up postgres and run the 
ddl commands contained in teststream.sql against the postgres 
database.

The Makefile also builds a program called teststreamsource which will
generate data in the format expected by the sample wrapper.

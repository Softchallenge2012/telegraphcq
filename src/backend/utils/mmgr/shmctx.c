/*--------------------
 * MemoryContextCreate
 *		Context-type-independent part of context creation.
 *
 * This is only intended to be called by context-type-specific
 * context creation routines, not by the unwashed masses.
 *
 * The context creation procedure is a little bit tricky because
 * we want to be sure that we don't leave the context tree invalid
 * in case of failure (such as insufficient memory to allocate the
 * context node itself).  The procedure goes like this:
 *	1.	Context-type-specific routine first calls MemoryContextCreate(),
 *		passing the appropriate tag/size/methods values (the methods
 *		pointer will ordinarily point to statically allocated data).
 *		The parent and name parameters usually come from the caller.
 *	2.	MemoryContextCreate() attempts to allocate the context node,
 *		plus space for the name.  If this fails we can elog() with no
 *		damage done.
 *	3.	We fill in all of the type-independent MemoryContext fields.
 *	4.	We call the type-specific init routine (using the methods pointer).
 *		The init routine is required to make the node minimally valid
 *		with zero chance of failure --- it can't allocate more memory,
 *		for example.
 *	5.	Now we have a minimally valid node that can behave correctly
 *		when told to reset or delete itself.  We link the node to its
 *		parent (if any), making the node part of the context tree.
 *	6.	We return to the context-type-specific routine, which finishes
 *		up type-specific initialization.  This routine can now do things
 *		that might fail (like allocate more memory), so long as it's
 *		sure the node is left in a state that delete will handle.
 *
 * This protocol doesn't prevent us from leaking memory if step 6 fails
 * during creation of a top-level context, since there's no parent link
 * in that case.  However, if you run out of memory while you're building
 * a top-level context, you might as well go home anyway...
 *
 * Normally, the context node and the name are allocated from
 * TopMemoryContext (NOT from the parent context, since the node must
 * survive resets of its parent context!).	However, this routine is itself
 * used to create TopMemoryContext!  If we see that TopMemoryContext is NULL,
 * we assume we are creating TopMemoryContext and use malloc() to allocate
 * the node.
 *
 * Note that the name field of a MemoryContext does not point to
 * separately-allocated storage, so it should not be freed at context
 * deletion.

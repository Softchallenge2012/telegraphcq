* Clean up the code in pg_exec_query_string

  Right now there is a big mass of code identifying all the different
  paths in which queries are compiled in our system (SQ,CQ,Flux
  etc.). A big disadvantage of this is that this is loosely copied in
  the explain code (ExplainQuery in backend/commands/explain.c). If
  this code is properly abstracted we can reuse it in explain and in
  pg_exec_query_string - this way we can have proper EXPLAIN support
  for our queries .. this will be a big debugging aid.

* Clean up window semantics

* Support views

* Move aggregates to the front end

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
that supports an extended subset of the SQL standard, including
transactions, foreign keys, subqueries, triggers, user-defined types
and functions.  This distribution also contains several language
bindings, including C, Perl, Python, and Tcl, as well as a JDBC
driver.

The ODBC and C++ interfaces have been moved to the PostgreSQL Projects
Web Site at http://gborg.postgresql.org for separate maintenance.

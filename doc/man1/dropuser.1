.SH NAME
dropuser \- remove a PostgreSQL user account
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdropuser\fR\fR [ \fR\fB\fIoptions\fB\fR...\fB \fR\fR]\fR\fR [ \fR\fB\fIusername\fB \fR\fR]\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdropuser\fR removes an existing
PostgreSQL user
\fBand\fR the databases which that user owned.
Only users with usesuper set in
the pg_shadow table can destroy 
PostgreSQL users.
.PP
\fBdropuser\fR is a shell script wrapper around the
SQL command
DROP USER [\fBdrop_user\fR(7)] via
the PostgreSQL interactive terminal
\fBpsql\fR(1). Thus, there is nothing
special about removing users via this or other methods. This means
that the \fBpsql\fR must be found by the script and that
a database server is running at the targeted host. Also, any default
settings and environment variables available to \fBpsql\fR
and the \fBlibpq\fR front-end library do apply.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBdropuser\fR accepts the following command-line arguments:
.TP

You will be prompted for a name if none is specified on the command line.

.TP
\fB--host \fIhost\fB\fR

.TP

.TP

Specifies the Internet TCP/IP port or local Unix domain socket file 
extension on which the server

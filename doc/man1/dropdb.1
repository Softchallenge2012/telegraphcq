.SH NAME
dropdb \- remove a PostgreSQL database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdropdb\fR\fR [ \fR\fB\fIoptions\fB\fR...\fB \fR\fR]\fR \fB\fIdbname\fB\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdropdb\fR destroys an existing
PostgreSQL database.
The user who executes this command must be a database
superuser or the owner of the database.
.PP
\fBdropdb\fR is a shell script wrapper around the
SQL command
DROP DATABASE [\fBdrop_database\fR(7)] via
the PostgreSQL interactive terminal
\fBpsql\fR(1). Thus, there is nothing
special about dropping databases via this or other methods. This means
that the \fBpsql\fR must be found by the script and that
a database server is running at the targeted host. Also, any default
settings and environment variables available to \fBpsql\fR
and the \fBlibpq\fR front-end library do apply.
.SH "OPTIONS"

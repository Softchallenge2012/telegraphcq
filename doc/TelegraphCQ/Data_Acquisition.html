<h2>Data Acquisition in TelegraphCQ</h2>
<br>
TelegraphCQ interacts with data sources via its wrapper clearinghouse
process.&nbsp; The wrapper clearing house manages connections with
external data sources, and the user defined wrappers which read data
from these data sources.&nbsp; The sole function of the wrapper
clearinghouse is to set-up, schedule, and clean up&nbsp; wrapper
instances.<br>
<br>
<h3>What is a wrapper?</h3>
<br>
A wrapper consists of a set of functions which are defined using the
Postgres CREATE FUNCTION command.&nbsp; A wrapper will typically define
an initialization function, a next data tuple function, a done
function, and possibly a rescan function.&nbsp; The init, next, and
done functions are used by the wrapper clearing house to set up wrapper
state, retrieve data rows from the data source, and
cleanup when the wrapper is done.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
TelegraphCQ supports two types of data sources.&nbsp; PUSH data sources
initiate a connection to TelegraphCQ, declare which wrapper should
handle the data, and which stream will receive the data once it has
been turned into a data tuple. <br>
<br>
A PULL type source is not aware of TelegraphCQ, and thus cannot
initiate a connection to it.&nbsp; For such sources, the wrapper must
set up a connection to the data source in its init
function.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, some PULL sources may require that
TelegraphCQ send some information to the source before it will produce
data results.&nbsp; An example of such a source would be a data
provider that returns search results in response to a set of key
words.&nbsp; The last wrapper function, the rescan function,is
required for PULL sources which require input values in order to
produce
data items. <br>
<br>
Wrappers can also have a set of KEY/VALUE pairs associated with them
when they are created. This information, which is typically used for
wrapper or wrapper clearinghouse configuration,&nbsp; can be retrieved
via an API&nbsp; from within a wrapper function.<br>
<br>
<h4>Specifing the wrapper type</h4>
<br>
A wrapper can be either a PUSH or PULL type wrapper.&nbsp; Setting the
WRAPPERTYPE configuration parameter to either PUSH or PULL specifies
the type of the wrapper.&nbsp; By default wrappers are PUSH type
wrappers.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<h3>The CSV Wrapper</h3>
<br>
Many TelegraphCQ users may not want to worry about the details of
wrapper implementation.&nbsp; We have developed a flexible wrapper that
will serve the needs of many users.<br>
<br>
The wrapper supports the input of data that arrives at the server in a
delimited format.&nbsp; By default the per column delimiters are
commas, and data tuples are delimited by a newline, but these defaults
can be overridden using wrapper configuration parameters.&nbsp;
Further, the number of columns in a data item need not match the number
of columns in the target stream exactly: data tuples with too many
items will be truncated by the wrapper to fit into the target, and data
tuples with fewer columns will be padded with NULL&#8217;s for the columns
that are missing.<br>
<br>
Recall that each TelegraphCQ data stream must have a special timestamp
attribute which the executor uses for stream operations.&nbsp; This
timestamp attribute must be the last attribute in any stream that will
be used with the CSV wrapper.<br>
<br>
The data conversion for a particular column uses the postgres data
input function for the type of the column in the target stream.&nbsp;
If this function is unable to do the conversion, that column will have
a NULL value.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Setting up the CSV wrapper</h4>
<br>
The CSV wrapper is predefined in the system catalogs.&nbsp; A wrapper
named csvwrapper is available immediately upon installation.&nbsp;
Users may create additional instances of the CSV wrapper with different
configuration parameters using the CREATE WRAPPER DDL statement.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The pre-defined wrapper functions for the CSV wrapper are called:<br>
Csv_init&nbsp; -- initialization function<br>
Csv_next &#8211; next tuple<br>
Csv_done -- cleanup<br>
<br>
<h4>Providing data to the CSV wrapper</h4>
<br>
By default, the wrapper clearinghouse listens for connections from PUSH
data sources on port 5533.&nbsp; A simple perl script called source.pl
is provided with the distribution to send data to the wrapper
clearinghouse.&nbsp; It functions much like the unix &#8220;tee&#8221; command with
its input going both to TelegraphCQ and the standard output.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The script is invoked as follows: <br>
<br>
source.pl hostname port name<br>
<br>
the host and port specify the location where the wrapper clearinghouse
listens for connections.<br>
<br>
The name string is actually composed of two parts separated by
commas.&nbsp; The first is the name of the wrapper that will be used to
process the data stream (in this example, csvwrapper).&nbsp; The second
is the fully qualified name of the stream that will receive the data
(this, for instance, might be myschema.csvstream)<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Configuring the CSV wrapper</h4>
<br>
By default, the CSV wrapper expects columns to be delimited by
commas.&nbsp; These per column delimiters can be overridden by creating
a new wrapper object.&nbsp; The following wrapper attributes are
recognized by the CSV wrapper:<br>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="1"
 style="text-align: left; width: 100%;">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">KEY<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">VALUE<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">DELIMITERS#</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">,A string containing all the
possible delimiters for a particular column, numbered starting from 0<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">DEFAULT_DELIMITERS</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">&nbsp;Set up the delimiters for
columns not explicitly specified using the DELIMITERS# key.&nbsp; The
default is ,<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">ERROR_INDICATOR</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">When the csv wrapper looks for a
new data row, it first looks to see if the row begins with the text
specified in the error_indicator key.&nbsp; If so, the error message is
extracted, and the wrapper passes the error back to the wrapper
clearinghouse.&nbsp; The default for this column is &#8220;ERROR:&#8221;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">DONE_INDICATOR</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">This key is used only&nbsp; for
wrappers which retrieve rows in response to some query that has been
sent via the rescan function.&nbsp; For such wrappers, the text in this
key is used by the csv_next function to determine when all of the
results for a particular query have been processed.&nbsp; The default
is &#8220;DONE WITH PROBE&#8221;<br>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>
      </span></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

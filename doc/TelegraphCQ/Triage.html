<h1>Load Shedding in TelegraphCQ</h1>
For situations where real-time query response is a priority,
TelegraphCQ can shed excess data from incoming data streams. The
architecture that TelegraphCQ uses to do this is called Data Triage.
The basic idea behind Data Triage is what we call "summarize what you
would drop". &nbsp;When the wrapper clearinghouse detects that it does
not have time to process a tuple, it <span style="font-style: italic;">triages</span>
the tuple, adding it to a compact <span style="font-style: italic;">summary</span>
along with the other triaged tuples. Periodically, the wrapper
clearinghouse sends these summaries to the backend, where the user can
use a <span style="font-style: italic;">shadow query </span>to
reconstruct approximately what query answers she is missing.<br>
<h2>Selecting Summary Type</h2>
For unarchived streams, you can choose what type of summary to generate
when triaging tuples by appending an <span class="code">ON OVERLOAD</span>
clause to the <span class="code">CREATE STREAM</span> statement:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<pre>                                                          +-- BLOCK
                                                          +-- DROP<br>CREATE STREAM [stream name] TYPE UNARCHIVED ON OVERLOAD --+<br>                                                          |          +-- COUNTS<br>                                                          |          +-- REGHIST    <br>                                                          +-- KEEP --+-- MYHIST<br>                                                                     +-- WAVELET ( '[wavelet params]' )<br>                                                                     +-- SAMPLE</pre>
The arguments of the ON OVERLOAD clause have the following meanings:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span class="code">BLOCK</span> means to stop reading tuples if the query 
  engine is not consuming them fast enough.</li>
  <li><span class="code">DROP</span> means to drop triaged tuples
without constructing any summaries.</li>
  <li><span class="code">KEEP COUNTS</span> means to keep counts of the
triaged tuples</li>
  <li><span class="code">KEEP REGHIST</span> means to build fixed-grid
multidimensional histograms of triaged tuples</li>
  <li><span class="code">KEEP MYHIST</span> means to build MHIST
multidimensional histograms (the strange name is to avoid collisions
with the name of the <span class="code">MHIST</span> datatype that
implements these histograms)</li>
  <li><span class="code">KEEP WAVELET</span> means to build
wavelet-based histograms</li>
  <li><span class="code">KEEP SAMPLE</span> means to keep a reservoir
sample</li>
</ul>
The default behavior is <span class="code">ON OVERLOAD BLOCK.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE: </span>Currently, TelegraphCQ
does not perform any Data Triage on archived streams. If the data rate
of an archived stream exceeds the system's capacity to consume data,
the wrapper clearinghouse will <span style="font-weight: bold;">block</span>.<br>
<h3>Summarizing "Kept" Tuples</h3>
To estimate the missing results of queries containing stream-stream
joins, the wrapper clearinghouse also needs to summarize the tuples
that are <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> triaged.
Summarizing these tuples is<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>only
necessary if the user is running a query with stream-stream joins. The
parameter <span class="code">load_shedding_disable_kept_summaries</span>
in <span class="code">postgresql.conf</span> allows the user to
disable these summaries for a slight performance improvement.
<h2>The Summary Streams</h2>
For a stream with the name schema.stream, TelegraphCQ will
automatically create auxiliary summary streams <span class="code">schema.__stream_dropped</span>
and <span class="code">schema.__stream_kept</span>, representing the
triaged tuples and the non-triaged tuples, respectively. For all
summary types except samples, the schema of a summary stream is:<br>
<span class="code">(summary [summary type], window_num integer,
prev_tcqtime Timestamp, tcqtime Timestamp)</span><br>
Where:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span class="code">summary</span> holds the summary data structure</li>
  <li><span class="code">window_num</span> identifies the summary time
window (summaries are sent at the end of each summary window)</li>
  <li><span class="code">prev_tcqtime</span> and <span class="code">tcqtime</span>
represent the time interval from which the tuples in the summary came</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sample Summaries</h3>
The <span class="code">SAMPLE</span> summary type tells the Triage
subsystem to generate fixed-size samples the tuples it triages. The
schema of these tuples is the same as the original stream, with the
addition of a new column <span class="code">__samplemult</span> of
type <span class="code">real</span> (aka <span class="code">float4</span>).
The <span class="code">__samplemult</span> column contains the
number of triaged tuples that are represented by each tuple in the sample.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">NOTE: Currently, the original stream
needs to contain the __samplemult field. This will change!</span>

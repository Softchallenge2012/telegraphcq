<h1>Punctuation
in TelegraphCQ</h1>
TelegraphCQ supports basic punctuation tuples. A punctuation tuple is a
tuple with just a timestamp attribute and no data. TelegraphCQ inserts
punctuation tuples into streams to indicate that no tuples with
timestamps before than the indicated value will occur in the stream.
<br>
<h2>Implementation of Punctuation</h2>
Punctuation tuples are implemented as <span class="code">HeapTuples</span>
with every field Additionally, TelegraphCQ sets the bit <span
 class="code">HEAP_ISPUNCT</span>
in a punctuation tuple's header. Code
can use the <span class="code">HeapTupleIsPunct()</span>
macro to
check whether a tuple is a punctuation tuple.<br>
<br>
TelegraphCQ uses the function <span class="code">form_punct_tup()</span>
to create punctuation tuples.<br>
<br>
<h2>Punctuation Producers</h2>
Portions of TelegraphCQ that generate punctuation tuples are:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The CSV wrapper: </span>If
the
CSV wrapper is generating its own timestamps, it will send periodic
punctuation tuples during quiet periods. Currently, the wrapper sends a
punctuation tuple whenever it goes for a second without receiving any
tuples.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Fjord Aggregate node: </span>This
operator, which takes care of windowed aggregates, places a punctuation
tuple after every group of aggregate tuples. The node timestamps the
tuple with the <span style="font-style: italic;">next</span> point in
time at which it will output aggregate results, indicating that there
will be no results until then. This punctuation should allow a query
that uses an aggregate subquery to put a time window over that
aggregate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Punctuation Consumers</h2>
We modified several operators to handle punctuation properly:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;" class="code">Agg</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> node</span>: This node, which handles <span
 class="code">GROUP BY</span> and aggregation, consumes punctuation
tuples without sending them through its tree of operators.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The <span
 style="font-weight: bold;" class="code">GSFilter </span>node:</span>
This node, which handles most selections, passes punctuation tuples
through to all queries.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The <span
 style="font-weight: bold;" class="code">Filter</span> node:</span>
This node, which handles generic selection predicates for a single
stream, always passes through punctuation tuples.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The HeapTuple code:</span> The
function <span class="code">DataFill()</span>, which is used to fill
in the <span class="code">t_data</span> fields of copied HeapTuples,
now copies over the <span class="code">HEAP_ISPUNCT</span> flag, along
with the other flags.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Projection functions:</span>&nbsp;<span
 class="code">ExecTargetList()</span>, which performs projection by
creating a copy of the input tuple with just the fields being kept, now
copies the <span class="code">HEAP_ISPUNCT</span> flag into the new
tuple.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data Triage:</span> The code
that constructs summaries of kept and triaged tuples (in particular the
function <span class="code">tupbuf_insert()</span>) ignores
punctuation.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The FSTeM Module:</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Work in progress</span>; when an FSTeM
receives a punctuation tuple as a probe, it should append a HeapTuple
of NULLs to the punctuation tuple and return the resulting
IntermediateHeapTuple to the Eddy.</li>
</ul>

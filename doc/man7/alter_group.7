.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBALTER GROUP\fR is used to add or remove users from a
group. Only database superusers can use this command.
Adding a user to a group does not create the user. Similarly, removing
a user from a group does not drop the user itself.
.PP
Use CREATE GROUP [\fBcreate_group\fR(7)]
to create a new group and DROP GROUP [\fBdrop_group\fR(7)] to remove a group.
.SH "USAGE"
.PP
Add users to a group:
.sp
.nf
ALTER GROUP staff ADD USER karl, john;
.sp
.fi
Remove a user from a group:
.sp
.nf
ALTER GROUP workers DROP USER beth;
.sp
.fi
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.SS "SQL92"
.PP
There is no \fBALTER GROUP\fR statement in
SQL92. The concept of roles is
similar.

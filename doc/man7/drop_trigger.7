.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBDROP TRIGGER\fR will remove an existing
trigger definition. To execute this command the current
user must be the owner of the table for which the trigger is defined.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Destroy the if_dist_exists trigger
on table films:
.sp
.nf
DROP TRIGGER if_dist_exists ON films;
.sp
.fi
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.TP
\fBSQL92\fR
There is no \fBDROP TRIGGER\fR statement in
SQL92.
.TP
\fBSQL99\fR
The \fBDROP TRIGGER\fR statement in
PostgreSQL is incompatible with
SQL99. In SQL99, trigger names are not local to tables, so the
command is simply DROP TRIGGER
\fIname\fR.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
CREATE TRIGGER [\fBcreate_trigger\fR(7)]
